I found a really interesting article on [How to Save Your Failing Software Development Initiatives](https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/dont-become-a-statistic-how-to-save-your-failing-software-development-initiatives/) on [SDTimes](https://sdtimes.com "A cool Software Development news website")

I love how this article speaks directly to a fear that many students, including myself, face on a daily basis as Software Engineers. The fear of failure is extremely disheartening, *especially* when the best project ideas out there require countless amounts of time and commitment. I can not count the amount of times that I have had a good idea worth developing, but ended up not doing anything past conceptual work due to the fear of not succeeding. Damen Gilland pinpoints the main things to focus on to address how to save a failing initiative, and he lines it up in a way that makes failure seem much less scary. I found the following excerpt particularly interesting:  
>**Expect the unexpected**

>Perfect path testing leaves a lot to chance. What happens when an API you depend on fails? If you don’t know, or didn’t build in the right fallback or user messaging, you’re going to have unhappy customers. So make sure you have a process for creating comprehensive and realistic test data, or pulling sanitized data from production that you can use as part of testing. Having realistic tests, imperfect-path tests, or even some chaos testing, can really help you at this stage.  

Since my project proposal states the use of an API, this section of the article grabbed my attention immediately. A huge part of the project will be streamlining the usage of the API, so I'm sure my team will run into problems in which the API does not work as intended. I will definitely be using his advice to ensure that in the event that this happens, the appropriate fallback will be in place for our users.
